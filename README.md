# ![](http://www.designemergente.org/laga/logoLarge.png)Laga
Laga is .Net library to primarly design and creates Genetic Algorithms. Nevertheless in the latest years many other features have been added, to make my job easy: I'm an architect.
Here you will find the latest compiled version of Laga and previous versions as well.
Download the whole folder, with the DLL and XML file (for documentation).
